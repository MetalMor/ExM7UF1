Once installed, the simple laravel new command will create a fresh Laravel installation in the directory you specify. For instance, laravel new blog will create a directory named blog containing a fresh Laravel installation with all of Laravel's dependencies already installed. This method of installation is much faster than installing via Composer:

laravel new blog

Via Composer Create-Project

You may also install Laravel by issuing the Composer create-project command in your terminal:

composer create-project laravel/laravel --prefer-dist
